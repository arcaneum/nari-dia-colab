# Plan to Review, Commit, and Push Project Changes

This plan outlines the steps to review the current project state, commit any changes, and push them to the remote repository `https://github.com/arcaneum/nari-dia-colab.git`.

## Steps:

1.  **Review Workspace Status:**
    *   Check the current Git status of the workspace to identify all modified, added, deleted, or untracked files. This step is crucial to understand what changes are present before committing.

2.  **Stage Changes:**
    *   Add the desired changes to the Git staging area. This prepares them for the commit. This typically involves adding all relevant files or directories.

3.  **Commit Changes:**
    *   Create a new Git commit containing the staged changes. A clear and descriptive commit message should be provided to explain the purpose of the changes.

4.  **Push Changes:**
    *   Push the newly created commit from the local repository to the specified remote repository (`https://github.com/arcaneum/nari-dia-colab.git`). This makes the changes available on GitHub.
